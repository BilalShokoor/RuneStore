# RuneStore

OSRS (Old School RuneScape) account marketplace project. Currently in **planning/research phase**.

## Project Structure

- `market_analysis.md` - Comprehensive competitive market analysis: 16 platforms, 129+ account listings, 10 price tiers
- `account_database.csv` - Raw pricing database with 129+ individual account listings across 8 sources
- `business_considerations.md` - Business intelligence: production economics, legal risks, payment strategy, platform fees, marketing, trust building, seasonal trends, key metrics
- `.gitignore` - Standard ignore patterns

## Market Context

- 16 competitors analyzed across dedicated stores, marketplaces, forums, and buying services
- Price range: $0.38 (bot starters) to $30,000 (ultra-premium PlayerAuctions)
- Best volume segment: 1 Def Pures ($50-$200) and Zerkers ($49-$499)
- Best margin segment: Infernal Cape accounts (+$100-$200 premium) and HCIM
- Jagex Launcher OTP is standard for new accounts; legacy accounts are premium for resale
- Account recovery is the #1 buyer concern and business risk
- OSRS has ~100k average concurrent players, growing market
- Seasonal peaks in winter holidays and around major game updates
- Crypto payments strongly preferred (eliminates chargebacks)
- AccountWarehouse shut down due to Jagex enforcement - cautionary precedent

## Key Competitors to Watch

| LuckyCharmGold | Deepest pure/zerker inventory (~300), lifetime warranty, 1,600+ Sythe vouches |

## Current Status & Next Steps
