- `.gitignore` - Standard ignore patterns

## Market Context

- Price range: $0.38 (bot starters) to $30,000 (ultra-premium PlayerAuctions)
- Best volume segment: 1 Def Pures ($50-$200) and Zerkers ($49-$499)
- Best margin segment: Infernal Cape accounts (+$100-$200 premium) and HCIM
- Jagex Launcher OTP is standard for new accounts; legacy accounts are premium for resale
- Account recovery is the #1 buyer concern and business risk
- OSRS has ~100k average concurrent players, growing market
- Seasonal peaks in winter holidays and around major game updates
- Crypto payments strongly preferred (eliminates chargebacks)
