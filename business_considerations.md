**Date:** February 2026

## 1. OSRS Player Base & Market Size

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total OSRS Accounts Created | ~40 million | MMO Population |
| Average Concurrent Players (2024-2026) | 80,000 - 100,000 | OSRS Money Making Guide |
| Peak Concurrent (2025 Record) | 240,756 | MMO Populations |
| Feb 2026 Peak | 246,403 | PlayerAuctions |
| Feb 2026 Close | 205,542 (+2.6% MoM) | PlayerAuctions |
| Steam-Only Peak (Feb 10 2026) | 1,760 | Steam Charts |
| Accounts Available for Purchase (est.) | 1,500 - 2,000+ at any time | Multi-source |

**Key insight:** Steam represents only a fraction of the total player base - most players use the native Jagex Launcher or mobile client. The game is growing, not shrinking, with baselines rising from 15k (2013) to 100k (2024).

## 2. Seasonal Trends & Demand Cycles

| Period | Player Activity | Account Demand | Notes |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Winter Holidays (Dec-Jan)** | Peak (+25-30%) | Highest | Holiday break = gaming surge |
| **League Launches** | Spike (+30-40%) | High | Temporary leagues drive huge player influx |
| **Major Content Updates** | Spike (+20%) | High | New raids, quests drive returning players |
| **Summer (Jun-Aug)** | Dip (-10-15%) | Lower | Players outdoors, reduced engagement |
| **Weekends** | +10-15% vs weekdays | Higher | Weekend warriors shopping |
| **Evening Hours (NA/EU)** | Daily peak | Best selling window | Match listing refresh to peak hours |

**Demand triggers to watch:**
- New raid releases (e.g., Tombs of Amascut drove 20% spike)
- Temporary game modes (Leagues, Deadman Mode)
- 2020 COVID lockdowns produced 25% sustained uplift
- Game updates that create new account build metas

## 3. Account Production Economics

### Time to Train by Account Type

| Account Type | Hours to Train | Membership Cost | Production Cost (est.) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 40 Base Melee Starter | 5-10 hrs | 1 bond ($6.99-$8.99) | ~$10 labor |
| 60 Base Melee Starter | 15-25 hrs | 1 bond | ~$15 labor |
| 1 Def Pure (40/99/1) | 80-120 hrs | 2-3 bonds ($14-$27) | ~$50-80 labor |
| Maxed Pure (99 STR + 99 RNG + quests) | 150-250 hrs | 4-6 bonds | ~$100-150 labor |
| Zerker (45 DEF, quests, stats) | 200-350 hrs | 5-8 bonds | ~$150-200 labor |
| Max Melee Main (99 ATT/STR/DEF) | 300-500 hrs | 6-10 bonds | ~$200-300 labor |
| Quest Cape Main (332 QP + stats) | 500-800 hrs | 8-12 bonds | ~$300-500 labor |
| Maxed Account (2,277 TL) | 1,700-3,700 hrs | 12-24+ bonds | ~$1,000-2,000+ labor |
| Ironman (mid-game, BG + Graceful) | 300-500 hrs | 6-10 bonds | ~$200-350 labor |
| HCIM (no deaths, end-game) | 1,000-3,000+ hrs | 12+ bonds | ~$800-2,000+ labor |

### Fastest Training XP Rates (Key Skills)

| Skill | Method | XP/Hour | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| Melee (STR) | NMZ | 50,000-60,000 | Semi-AFK, 99 STR ~220 hrs |
| Ranged | Chinning (Red Chins, MM2) | Up to 1,000,000 | Expensive but very fast |
| Magic | Ice Bursting/Barraging (MM1/MM2) | 200,000-400,000 | Requires quest completion |
| Fletching | Fastest 99 | ~56 min to 99 | Essentially free |
| Agility | Rooftop courses | 50,000-65,000 | "Soul-crushing" - 165 hrs |
| Runecrafting | Various | 30,000-60,000 | 200+ hrs minimum |

### Membership/Bond Costs

| Method | Cost | Duration |
|--------|------|----------|
| Monthly subscription | $12.99/month | 30 days |
| Single bond (real money) | $6.99-$8.99 | 14 days |
| Bond (in-game GP) | ~9-15M GP | 14 days |

### Estimated Profit Margins by Account Type

| Account Type | Sell Price | Production Cost | Margin | Margin % |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 60 Base Melee Starter | $1.49 | ~$0.20 (botted) | $1.29 | 87% |
| 1 Def Pure (40/99) | $90 | ~$30-50 | $40-60 | 45-65% |
| Maxed Pure + Infernal | $359 | ~$150-200 | $159-209 | 44-58% |
| Zerker (maxed) | $224 | ~$100-150 | $74-124 | 33-55% |
| Infernal Zerker | $440 | ~$200-300 | $140-240 | 32-55% |
| Quest Cape Main | $370 | ~$200-350 | $20-170 | 5-46% |
| Maxed Account | $900 | ~$500-1,000 | -$100-$400 | Variable |
| HCIM (mid) | $300 | ~$200-350 | -$50-$100 | Variable |

**Key insight:** Starter accounts have the highest margin % but lowest absolute margin. Pures and zerkers offer the best balance of margin and volume. End-game and maxed accounts have thin or negative margins unless sourced cheaply.

## 4. Supply Chain Models

### Model 1: Self-Trained (Premium)
- **Pro:** Natural play patterns, lowest ban risk, full control over account details
- **Con:** Extremely time-intensive, does not scale
- **Best for:** Premium accounts ($200+) where quality justifies time investment

### Model 2: Third-Party Manual Training (Venezuelan Workers)
- **Pro:** Cost-effective, human play patterns, lower ban risk than bots
- **Con:** Requires managing remote workers, quality control challenges
- **Services:** FancyHire and similar power-leveling services
- **Best for:** Mid-tier accounts ($50-$200) at scale

### Model 3: Botted Accounts (Cheapest)
- **Pro:** Cheapest per-unit cost, highly scalable
- **Con:** High ban risk - Jagex bans 67,000+ accounts per week, only 0.36% of bans overturned
- **Risk:** Accounts that repeat actions for long periods get flagged
- **Best for:** Disposable starter accounts ($0.38-$6) where bans are a cost of doing business

### Model 4: Buy from Quitting Players (Broker)
- **Pro:** Legitimate play history, lowest recovery risk, no production time
- **Con:** Unpredictable supply, requires accurate valuation skills
- **Operators:** AccountKings, AccountShark
- **Best for:** Unique high-value accounts with legitimate histories

### Recommended: Hybrid Approach
Combine multiple supply sources to diversify risk and serve different market segments simultaneously.

## 5. Storefront & Platform Strategy

### Platform Fee Comparison

| Platform | Free Tier Fee | Paid Plan | Paid Fee | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Sell.app** | 3% per sale | $199.99/mo | 0% | Clean interface, low fees |
| **Sellix.io** | 5% per sale | 29 EUR/mo (Pro) | 2% | 50+ payment methods, crypto |
| **Selly.io** | Free under $10 | Tiered | Tiered | Micro-transactions |
| **Shoppy.gg** | 0% PayPal, 2% BTC | N/A | N/A | Simplest fee structure |

**Payment processor fees are additional:** ~3.5% for credit cards, 0% for direct Bitcoin.

### Marketplace Fee Comparison

| Marketplace | Fee | Buyer Traffic | Protection |
|-------------|-----|---------------|------------|
| **PlayerAuctions** | ~5% + disbursement | Very High | Escrow + dispute resolution |
| **Eldorado.gg** | ~8% + $0.30 | High | TradeShield (5-day insurance) |
| **G2G** | 5-10% (tiered by rank) | High | Escrow |
| **Sythe.org** | Free (middleman 3-5%) | Medium-High | Reputation/vouch system |

### Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Model
1. **Own storefront** (Sell.app at 3%) for direct/repeat customers and maximum margins
2. **List on 1-2 marketplaces** (PlayerAuctions + Eldorado) for buyer traffic and discovery
3. **Maintain Sythe.org presence** for community credibility and vouch accumulation
4. **Run a Discord server** for repeat customer engagement and real-time delivery

## 6. Payment & Chargeback Considerations

### Payment Method Risk Matrix

| Method | Chargeback Risk | Fee | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|-----|----------------|
| **Cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, USDT)** | **None** (irreversible) | 0% | Strongly preferred - offer discount to incentivize |
| **CashApp / Venmo** | Low | Low | Acceptable secondary option |
| **PayPal Friends & Family** | Low | Low | Buyers resist (no protection for them) |
| **PayPal Goods & Services** | **HIGH** | 3% | AVOID - sellers almost always lose disputes for digital goods |
| **Credit Card via Platform** | Medium | ~3.5% | OK if platform has chargeback protection |

**Critical warning:** PayPal Goods & Services is notoriously dangerous for virtual goods sellers. Even with delivery evidence, PayPal almost always sides with the buyer in disputes.

### Chargeback Prevention Tactics
- Prioritize crypto payments (offer 5-10% discount)
- Use platforms with built-in protection (Eldorado's TradeShield)
- Require identity verification for high-value orders
- Maintain detailed delivery logs with timestamps and screenshots
- Avoid direct credit card processing without fraud protection

## 7. Account Security & Delivery

### Jagex Launcher vs Legacy Login System

| Feature | Legacy Login | Jagex Launcher (New) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| MFA/Authenticator | Optional (removable) | **Mandatory** (cannot disable) |
| Email Change | Standard process | Must transfer entire Jagex Account |
| Recovery Risk | Moderate | Lower (mandatory MFA complicates recovery) |
| Handoff Ease | **Easier** | More complex (need to transfer email + MFA) |
| Market Perception | **Premium** (easier to sell) | Standard for new accounts |
| Migration | Can migrate to Jagex Account (irreversible) | N/A - already Jagex Account |

**Critical insight:** As of January 2024, all **new** accounts are Jagex Accounts. Legacy accounts that haven't migrated are increasingly valuable for resale because they're easier to hand off. Jagex plans to make migration mandatory eventually - **this is a time-sensitive advantage for legacy inventory.**

### Standard Delivery Checklist
1. Login email address / username
2. Current account password
3. Access to registered email (or email change to buyer's address)
4. All recovery questions and answers
5. Original creation IP address (if available)
6. Authenticator removal / transfer instructions
7. Bank PIN (if set)

### Account Recovery - The #1 Risk
- Jagex's recovery system is designed to return accounts to original creators
- Recovery requires: creation ISP, creation date, payment history, original email, historical passwords
- **No mitigation can eliminate this risk entirely** - it can only be reduced

### Recovery Mitigation Methods
- Provide ALL original creation details to buyer
- Create accounts on dedicated IPs, share those with buyer
- Use fresh email addresses with no prior Jagex history
- Offer recovery warranties (replacement if recovered)
- Build long usage history before selling

### Competitor Warranty Comparison

| Seller | Warranty |
|--------|---------|
| LuckyCharmGold | Lifetime warranty against recovery |
| Probemas | Free recovery insurance on all accounts |
| Eldorado.gg | 5-day standard (free) + optional 1-year extended |
| AccountWarehouse | Previously "lifetime" - not honored after shutdown |
| PlayerAuctions | Platform dispute resolution (not seller warranty) |

---

## 8. Legal & Compliance Risks

### Jagex's Official Position
- **Account selling is explicitly prohibited** under Jagex Terms of Service
- All accounts are owned by Jagex - players have a license to use them
- Real World Trading (RWT) = buying or selling anything related to Jagex accounts for real-world value
- As of April 9, 2025: Jagex broadened RWT definition to include exchanges of "anything of value" (not just real money)
- **Penalty: Permanent ban without warning** under Rule 12

### Enforcement Evidence
- Jagex bans 67,000+ accounts per week (primarily bots, but RWT accounts included)
- Only 0.36% of ban appeals are successful
- AccountWarehouse shut down entirely citing Jagex enforcement pressure
- Jagex actively improves detection methods year over year

### Legal Considerations
- No known lawsuits against individual account sellers (as of 2026)
- EULA clearly states Jagex owns all accounts and in-game assets
- Selling accounts you don't legally own (by TOS) creates legal gray area
- No legal recourse if Jagex bans accounts - TOS violation voids claims
- Different jurisdictions may treat virtual goods differently

### Risk Mitigation
- Operate transparently with buyers about TOS risks
- Do not make guarantees that contradict Jagex's authority over accounts
- Consider business structure (LLC/corp) for liability protection
- Maintain detailed records of all transactions
- Be aware of consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction

## 9. Marketing & Customer Acquisition

### Advertising Channels (Ranked by Effectiveness)

| Channel | Traffic Quality | Cost | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------|-------|
| **Sythe.org** | Highest (active RWT community) | Free (time investment) | Build vouches over months |
| **Discord** | High (direct engagement) | Free | 97+ OSRS servers, run your own |
| **Marketplace Listings** | High (buyer intent) | Platform fees | Built-in SEO |
| **SEO / Content Marketing** | Medium-High | Time + hosting | Blog posts, buying guides |
| **EpicNPC / OwnedCore** | Medium | Free | Secondary forums |
| **Reddit** | Medium (indirect only) | Free | Direct selling banned in most subs |
| **Gaming Site Ads** | Medium | $100-$600/mo | RuneList, similar sites |
| **Facebook Groups** | Low | Free | Higher scam risk, less trusted |

### SEO Strategies Used by Top Competitors
1. **Content marketing:** "How to Price Your OSRS Account," "OSRS Account Value Guide"
2. **Long-tail keywords:** "OSRS zerker account for sale," "buy maxed OSRS account"
3. **Trustpilot profiles:** Review snippets appear in Google results
4. **Detailed product pages:** Each listing is its own SEO page
5. **Backlinks:** From gaming sites, review platforms, forums

### Listing Best Practices (What Top Sellers Include)
- Combat level and total level
- All individual skill levels
- Quests completed (emphasize key quests: DS2, SOTE, RFD, MM2)
- Bank value + notable items
- Build type classification
- Boss KC, collection log progress, minigame completions
- Rare items and pets
- Screenshots (stats page, bank, achievements)
- Whether Jagex Account or legacy
- Email status (set vs. unset)

## 10. Reputation & Trust Building

### The Trust Hierarchy
1. **Sythe.org Vouches** - Gold standard. 500+ vouches with donor status = trusted. Minimum safe threshold = 200 vouches.
2. **Trustpilot Reviews** - First thing buyers Google. Maintain active profile.
3. **Platform Reputation** - PlayerAuctions seller rating, Eldorado seller verification
4. **Discord Community** - Engaged repeat customers vouching for you
5. **Years in Business** - RPGStash (since 2004), ChicksGold (5+ years)

### Warning: Vouch Manipulation
Scammers buy existing high-vouch Sythe accounts to run scams. Verify: account age, posting continuity, behavior consistency, activity gaps.

### Trust-Building Playbook
1. Start with smaller trades to accumulate vouches
2. Create Trustpilot profile from day one
3. Offer 24/7 live chat support (signals professionalism)
4. Provide recovery warranties
5. Publish transparent refund/warranty policies
6. Maintain multi-platform presence (Sythe + Discord + Trustpilot + own store)
7. Create educational content (builds authority)
