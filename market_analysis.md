## 5. Key Market Observations

1. **Jagex Launcher OTP is now standard** - Most sellers advertise Jagex Launcher login, making accounts harder to recover and more trustworthy for buyers.

2. **Account recovery is the #1 buyer concern** - Every seller emphasizes "no recovery" guarantees. Eldorado.gg offers TradeShield insurance.

3. **AccountWarehouse shut down** - At least one major seller has closed due to Jagex enforcement, signaling risk in the market.

4. **EUR vs USD pricing** - European sellers (EzRSAccounts) price in EUR, which is ~8% higher than USD equivalent.

5. **The Infernal Cape premium** - Accounts with Infernal Cape consistently command 2-3x the price of equivalent accounts without it, because the Inferno is extremely difficult content.

6. **Volume vs. margin trade-off** - Starter accounts sell in the thousands at sub-$5 prices. Premium accounts sell individually at $300+. The middle ground (pures at $50-$170) offers the best balance.

7. **Storefront platforms** (Sell.app, Selly.io) make it easy for anyone to set up shop with minimal overhead.
